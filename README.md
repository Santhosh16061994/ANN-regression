# ANN-regression


ANN regression refers to the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for solving regression problems. In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous output variable based on input features.

An ANN used for regression tasks typically consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains multiple neurons (also called nodes), and the neurons are connected to the neurons in the adjacent layers through weighted connections. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the number of input features, while the number of neurons in the output layer is usually one for a single-output regression problem.

During training, the ANN learns to approximate the relationship between the input features and the continuous target variable by adjusting the weights of its connections. The training data consists of input-output pairs, where the input features are presented to the network, and the output of the network is compared with the actual target values. The network's weights are updated iteratively using optimization algorithms such as backpropagation to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

Once trained, the ANN can be used to make predictions on new input data. The input features are fed into the network, and the output layer produces the predicted continuous value. The network's ability to learn complex non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable makes it suitable for regression tasks that involve intricate patterns.

ANN regression has been successfully applied in various domains, including financial forecasting, time series analysis, stock market prediction, housing price estimation, and many others. However, as with any machine learning technique, the performance of ANN regression depends on factors such as the architecture of the network, the amount and quality of training data, and the selection of appropriate activation functions and optimization algorithms.
